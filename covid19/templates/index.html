        <h6>Project Philosophy</h6>
        <p> Our information supply is contaminated. In an era where generating content and publishing it is so easy,
            we are bombarded with irrelevant, redundant, unsolicited, incorrect, and otherwise low-value information,
            and some of it does not rank high on the truth scale. Our long term goal is to define and address some
            of the key research questions raised by the need to navigate our way through the information polluted
            space â€“ in politics, the medical domain, education, and more.</p>
        <hr>
        <h6>Immediate Goals</h6>
        <p> In the context of COVID-19, we would like to provide a reasonably-sized set of relevant, trustworthy, and
            timely information that would allow users to, rather quickly, become informed about the specific topics of
            interest to them. Our immediate goals are to --
        <ul>
            <li>Reduce information redundancy</li>
            <li>Provide a way for users to understand the relations between independently written documents.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To help critical readers become informed about a topic, it is important to expose them to relevant
            perspectives on a topic while minimizing the superfluous and redundant information. At the same
            time, it is important to expose and present relations between independently produced documents so that it is
            possible to evaluate the various emphases and nuances.

            Moreover, organizing the information available along the topics it addresses, the type of the source
            generating it, and the document type (e.g, factual reporting vs. opinion) helps the reader approach the
            subject in an orderly and efficient way.
        </p>
        <p>
            As researchers in Natural Language Understanding, we seek automated ways, driven by machine learning and
            inference methods, to understand the documents well enough so that we can support these objectives.
